## Challenges you ran into during the project.
    I ran into the problem of not knowing anythin about the Vercel platform or how to get python files running on it. I took some time to understand what Vercel was, and why python files would be able to be served via a web interface. I figured out that you intended for us to use the Python runtime with Serverless Functions to publish our code easily via the Vercel platform.
## What I learned during the project.
    I learned how to use the Vercel platform to edge host APIs and websites, along with writing HTTP Request Handler Code
## Overview of the backlog items you created.
    Browser tries to download python file. Figured out I needed to make the code a class extending a specific class.

## Speculate why you see a different IP address when running the code locally vs viewing the Vercel website.
    Because the code is being hosted and ran on a different sever when it is hosted via Vercel.

## URL of the Vercel website you created within part #4.
    https://module-4-silk.vercel.app/
